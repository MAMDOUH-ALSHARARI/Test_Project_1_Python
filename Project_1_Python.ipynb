This is a simple, yet fun, implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where you play against the computer.\n","\n","## How to Play:\n","- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.\n","- You are Player **X**, and the computer is Player **O**.\n","- To make a move, click on any of the empty cells. The computer will automatically respond with its move.\n","- The objective is to get three of your marks (X's) in a row â€“ horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n","- If all cells are filled and neither player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.\n","\n","## Game Features:\n","- **Interactive Gameplay:** You can interact with the game by clicking on the cells, and the computer will make its move immediately after yours.\n","- **Reset Button:** You can reset the game at any point to start a new round.\n","- **Live Status Updates:** The game displays live status updates such as whose turn it is, or whether someone has won or the game is a draw.\n","\n","Enjoy the game and test your strategy against the computer!\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oc-SooEd9iPk"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import numpy as np\n","import ipywidgets as widgets\n","from IPython.display import display\n","import random\n","\n","# OX Game (Tic-Tac-Toe) Logic\n","class TicTacToe:\n","    def __init__(self):\n","        self.board = np.full((3, 3), \"\")\n","        self.current_player = \"X\"\n","        self.game_over = False\n","        self.winner = None\n","\n","    def make_move(self, row, col):\n","        if self.board[row, col] == \"\" and not self.game_over:\n","            self.board[row, col] = self.current_player\n","            if self.check_winner():\n","                self.winner = self.current_player\n","                self.game_over = True\n","            elif np.all(self.board != \"\"):\n","                self.game_over = True\n","                self.winner = \"Draw\"\n","            else:\n","                self.current_player = \"O\" if self.current_player == \"X\" else \"X\"\n","\n","    def check_winner(self):\n","        #
