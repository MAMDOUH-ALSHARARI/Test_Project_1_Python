# OX Game

Welcome to the OX Game project! This is a simple and interactive implementation of the classic XO game, where you (Player X) go head-to-head against the computer (Player O). It's designed to be user-friendly, allowing anyone to play the game through their browser.

## Game URL
You can access and play the game via this link: [OX Game](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MAMDOUH-ALSHARARI/Test_Project_1_Python/HEAD?urlpath=voila%2Frender%2FProject_1_Python.ipynb)

## How to Play
- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- You are Player **X**, and the computer is Player **O**.
- Click on an empty cell to place your mark (X). The computer will then automatically place its mark (O).
- The goal is to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
- If no one achieves this and all cells are filled, the game ends in a draw.
- Use the **Reset** button to start a new game at any time.

## Features
- **Interactive Interface:** The game uses IPython Widgets to provide a smooth and interactive experience.
- **Computer interaction:** The computer responds instantly after your move with a simple AI that picks random available cells.
- **Status Updates:** See real-time updates about the game’s progress: whose turn it is, who won, or if the game resulted in a draw.
- **Restart Option:** Use the reset button to restart the game at any point.
